Various Interfaces that aid in collections .
IEnumerab1e is an Interface which has one method called
GetEnumerator(). This method returns a type of IEnumerator, which
is another interface
IEnumerator has 1 property called current that gives the data at
the current position, and 2 fumctions viz MoveNext(), and Reset() .
These 2 functions help in navigating the collections. FbveNext()
function returns true if there are elements in the collection, else
false.
Both the above interfaces are meant for iterating a collection.
IEnumerab1e is simpler than IEmulator
IComparabIe :
interface has one method called CompareTo(Object o)
that takes an object to compare with and return an int
0 = both are equal
-1 = first object is smaller than the second
1 = first object is larger than the second

is and as statements

is = a is b ? = checking if a and b are same
as = a as b = making a as b type

.............
Delegates :Are similar to function pointers of C/C++.
- Are reference types that holds the reference to a function/method, that can be changed at runtime
